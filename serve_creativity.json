    "abstract": "The body is amassed with electrical signals. These bioelectric signals are tied\nto both the most basic body functions such as the heart beating all the way to\nthe highest level of processing in the brain. These signals are often rhythmic\nin nature and provide a means to measure the fundamental rhythms of any\nindividual. In this performance we will generate music in real time from\nbioelectric signals that are read from a human subject. The ECG (heart) will set\nthe rhythm of the music while other signals including EEG (brain waves) and EMG\n(muscles) will be used by an algorithm to perform melodic and rhythmic choices.\nThe subject will participate by dancing and responding to the generated music\nand by virtue of their interaction will change the music produced. Additionally,\nthe signals will be sonified and form part of the music. Musician(s) will also\nimprovise along with the generated music with their instruments being modulated\nby the captured bioelectric signals.",

    "abstract": "Comic-based digital stories are brief but powerful illustrated digital stories. Comic-based digital storytelling has unique characteristics that provide much promise for Human Computer Interaction. Often associated with young people's entertainment, comics cover a broad range of topics, from superheros, to farming life (e.g., Footrot Flats). We have been co-creating comic-based digital stories in partnership with mental health programs in three contexts: a Victorian rural outreach program; tradespeople or 'tradies' focused mental health promotion program; and a student mental health service.\n\nWe showcase three diverse comic-based digital stories co-created with key stakeholders including service providers, community members and people with lived experience of mental health. They depict contextually situated mental health issues faced in the trades sector and in rural communities. The digital stories recognise some complexities of identifying mental health issues and help-seeking in these contexts. Comics were chosen for these digital stories due to their unique ability to resonate with young male audiences, create understanding, and help bridge health literacy and digital divides ([ref](https://www.academia.edu/62913326/_I_Understand_Mate_A_Co_Designed_Comic_based_Digital_Story_from_Down_Under)). They can be viewed online on personal devices or displayed during group outreach activities. A synopsis for the digital stories is below.\n\n**Trigger warning!** Please be aware these videos include content about mental health issues, domestic violence, drug use, suicide ideation and suicide.\n\n#### How to have a tough conversation about mental health\n\nThis auto-biographical 'origin' story showcases HALT (Hope and Assistance Local Tradies) health promotion presentations to tradespeople to highlight tradies mental health issues, reduce stigma in the trades industry and encourage mental health support uptake.\n\n#### Slamming the Mental Health Stigma at TAFE\n\nThis digital story was originally created as a comic-based booklet depicting mental health support provided by SLAM, a Technical and Further Education (TAFE) student support team. The booklet was distributed with student orientation handouts, shared during HALT-TAFE presentations, and will be shared online.\n\n#### The Rural Outreach Program illustrated digital story\n\nThis digital story was codesigned with a partnering organisation, rural outreach workers, local police and community members. It depicts the story of 'Sam' a young man struggling to cope with issues at home and illustrates how the rural outreach program supported him.",
