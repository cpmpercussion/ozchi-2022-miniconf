<h2>Call for participation</h2>
<p>The OzCHI Doctoral Consortium (DC) aims to provide a collegial and
inspiring environment to support doctoral students in successfully
completing their doctoral dissertations. The OzCHI DC is an opportunity
for PhD students to receive valuable feedback from experienced
researchers and colleagues, share and discuss their ongoing research,
and explore new research avenues.</p>
<p>We encourage all PhD students who have made concrete progress in their
research to apply. Ideal candidates for DC should have chosen a clear
research topic, reviewed the literature, and selected a research
methodology. DC candidates are expected to have sufficient time
remaining in their programs (typically 6-12 months) to incorporate
feedback provided during the event. The selection of the candidates is
based on the quality and maturity of the proposals, relevance to the
field and OzCHI audience as well as the potential level of contribution
of the DC to the PhD candidate's dissertation.</p>
<p>Note that there is <strong>no fee</strong> to attend the consortium.
However, you must register for at least one day of the OzCHI conference.</p>
<h3>Structure of the OzCHI Doctoral Consortium</h3>
<p>The doctoral consortium event is open to all OzCHI participants and
consists of three different sessions. The first session will be given by
an invited keynote speaker who will focus on <strong>common challenges
students face during their PhDs</strong>. The second session consists of the
presentation of research proposals by accepted DC candidates, followed
by an interactive Q&amp;A session with DC Chairs and the general public.
Finally, the third session consists of a 30-min individual mentoring
with an experienced member of our community who will provide more
detailed and focused feedback. The individual mentoring session is an
opportunity for students to discuss specific aspects of their research,
including research goals, methodology, experiments, etc. Students who
participated in the mentoring session will be invited to share their
experience with their peers, the audience and DC chairs.</p>
<h3>Keynote Speaker Professor Inger Mewburn, SFHEA, VRDSF</h3>
<p>Director of Researcher Development</p>
<p>Office of the Dean of Higher Degree by Research</p>
<p>The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia</p>
<p><img alt="Head shot of Professor Inger Mewburn" src="static/images/inger-mewburn.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>Professor Inger Mewburn (better known as @thesiswhisperer) was born on
Nuenonne country, which is now known as Tasmania, Australia (always was,
always will be, Aboriginal land). She has a background as a designer and
a researcher, which was nurtured at the University of Melbourne and RMIT
University.</p>
<p>Since 2006, she has worked exclusively with PhD students and early
career academics, helping them finish complex research projects with
(sometimes very) demanding stakeholders. She's passionate about helping
people reach their potential as researchers and helping to create a
kinder, more inclusive academy.</p>
<p>Inger is currently the Director of Researcher Development at The
Australian National University, where she oversees professional
development workshops and programs for all ANU researchers. Aside from
creating new posts on the Thesis Whisperer blog, she writes scholarly
papers, books and book chapters about research education, with a special
interest in post PhD employability.</p>
<p><strong>Keynote Topic: Academic writing after Covid</strong></p>
<p><em>Academics often struggle with the question of relevance. With the world in such turmoil, it can be hard to focus on the research and writing tasks at hand. In this keynote, Inger will talk about the common blocks to successful writing and some strategies to overcome them. At the end of the session, she will ask bigger questions about the place of academic writing in the future. All writing is a political act, even if the politics are beneath the surface and hard to see. If academia wants to stay relevant and continue to have the social license to seek support from our community, some academic practices must change.</em></p>
