    "TLDR": "This paper presents a scoping review of intergenerational active play to provide an overview of current research in HCI and related disciplines. Play has been widely perceived as a common activity among people of all ages. Physical activity and active play are essential to positive developmental outcomes, especially of those in preschool years. Intergenerational play can be beneficial to people of different generations by promoting meaningful interactions and healthy relationships. Finally, intergenerational active play shows great potential in fostering early childhood development and positive ageing for older adults. Digital technology provides opportunities for promoting intergenerational active play in new ways, such as digital games, exergames, and tangible embodied embedded interaction (TEIs). Based on the review, we present a framework for intergenerational active play which encapsulates the key concepts, challenges, and opportunities for future research and design.",

    "TLDR": "Minecraft has given rise to diverse gameplay, including public servers that provide survival gameplay combined with Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game elements. In these servers, gameplay includes many players fighting mobs (non-player enemies) together. However, it often happens that some players are experienced, while others are not. This leads to a problem where some players enjoy the level of challenge and consequently the game, while others can feel bored or discouraged. This paper proposes an approach to Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) that adjusts mobs in multiplayer Minecraft so that the difficulty level accommodates all players involved. We present a new Multiplayer Minecraft DDA Framework, a game design to populate our framework, and a user evaluation study to test our framework. Our work contributes to understanding DDA in multiplayer contexts and to creating better multiplayer experiences for Minecraft and other multiplayer games.",

However, since the foundation itself is close to the skin color, people cannot tell easily where they have applied it. Therefore, we proposed a system to detect and visualize uneven foundation application, and have succeeded in binary classification of bare skin and foundation skin. Here, visualizing the unevenness of foundation on the face may create a negative impression for users. Therefore, we studied a method to visualize the uneven application of foundation on the face, taking into consideration factors other than ease of understanding. As a result, we found that the most positive evaluation was a method that made it relatively easy to recognize where foundation had been applied unevenly and gives the impression of \u201cbright, warm, active and radiant\u201d.",

Consequently, there is a need to increase young children\u2019s engagement in active play and understand the factors that enable them to sustain this play. Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI) systems have shown promise to facilitate new opportunities for active play. Few TEIs have been designed to engage children aged 3 to 5 in active play. We ask the question, how can TEIs be better designed to effectively engage young children in active play? This paper begins to answer this question through an exploration into how young children currently engage in active play. We conducted semi-structured interviews with fifteen families and five early childhood teachers. These interviews highlighted activities, contexts, equipment, people, and environmental factors associated with active play engagement.  We found that equipment shapes children\u2019s activities and provides a context for active play. These findings can inform the design of new and innovative TEIs that facilitate new opportunities to engage young children in active play.",

Eight crane operators, who worked with both manual container cranes and remote container cranes with semi-autonomous control, were interviewed to explore what kinds of experiences that they have as the results of operating container cranes with both operational modes.

    "TLDR": "Home is a place to live and an environment to support and enhance our psychological well-being. Factors such as furniture selection and arrangements can contribute to more harmonized and balanced home environments. Augmented reality (AR) tools have recently gained attention in home interior design due to their competencies and potential in improving and envisioning the experience of living at home.

    "abstract": "Home is a place to live and an environment to support and enhance our psychological well-being. Factors such as furniture selection and arrangements can contribute to more harmonized and balanced home environments. Augmented reality (AR) tools have recently gained attention in home interior design due to their competencies and potential in improving and envisioning the experience of living at home. Following Feng Shui principles and iterative prototyping processes, we designed a high-fidelity AR prototype to guide users in making informed decisions about furniture arrangements at home.

The application, FrogID, was developed as part of a citizen science project to support frog conservation in Australia. FrogID crowdsources the collection of frog calls to build up a national database, which in turn can inform conservation strategies. The paper discusses the use of personas and other design tools to ensure the design solution considers the perspectives of frogs as a non-human stakeholder group and to facilitate interdisciplinary team collaboration. As a broader contribution to the field of interaction design, the paper discusses the responsibility of designers to advocate on behalf of stakeholders that don't have a voice.",

Our study included 71 participants who elaborated on the story stems we provided to them. Through a blending of thematic analysis coding and the techniques of developing grounded theory, we reveal that the common responses of students to extensive AI monitoring included impacts on personal psychology, changed behaviour, and cognition.

This poses a significant challenge for undergraduate students as it affects their understanding of how to measure, analyse, and interpret complex 3D structures. Geoscience education currently relies on the use of two-dimensional media to represent 3D structures within rock. This demonstrates a gap which could be addressed using Virtual Reality (VR). This paper presents a novel tool for the visualisation of geological folds; wave-like undulations of layered rock. With the help of a preliminary interview study, contextual inquiries, and the continued involvement of a subject-matter expert, we have begun development of an instructional module on geological folds using our novel fold visualisation tool. We conducted usability testing with na\u00efve users, undergraduate geology students, and the subject-matter expert. Future iterations of the tool and module will involve a plethora of working examples that students can use to learn terminology, practice measurements, and develop their interpretive skills of complex 3D-geometries.",

With the help of a preliminary interview study, contextual inquiries, and the continued involvement of a subject-matter expert, we have begun development of an instructional module on geological folds using our novel fold visualisation tool. We conducted usability testing with na\u00efve users, undergraduate geology students, and the subject-matter expert. Future iterations of the tool and module will involve a plethora of working examples that students can use to learn terminology, practice measurements, and develop their interpretive skills of complex 3D-geometries.",

    "TLDR": "Early participatory design (PD) projects tended to be of limited size and complexity. Over the last two decades, however, various attempts have been made to apply PD to large-scale information technology projects. Although studies have suggested that scaling the methodology to fit larger and more complex projects can be problematic, no attempts have been made to form a comprehensive overview of the associated challenges. To remedy this situation, a systematic literature review of relevant studies was conducted. From an initial 780 references retrieved from databases, 17 articles met the predefined criteria and were included in the review. The review resulted in the extraction of seven categories of challenges. A discussion of the identified challenges as a potential threat to the methodology\u2019s integrity is provided. The review offers a multifaceted understanding of the challenges related to the scaling of PD, which, given their nature, risk compromising core PD principles.",

Yet, capacitive touchscreens are limited in expressiveness; thus, a large body of work has focused on extending the input capabilities of touchscreens. One promising approach is to use index finger orientation; however, this requires a two-handed interaction and poses ergonomic constraints. We propose using the thumb's pitch as an additional input dimension to counteract these limitations, enabling one-handed interaction scenarios. Our deep convolutional neural network detecting the thumb's pitch is trained on more than 230,000 ground truth images recorded using a motion tracking system. We highlight the potential of ThumbPitch by proposing several use cases that exploit the higher expressiveness, especially for one-handed scenarios. We tested three use cases in a validation study and validated our model. Our model achieved a mean error of only 11.9\u00b0.",

However, it is not easily accessible due to scheduling difficulties or cost. Conversational agents (CAs) could provide more scalable access to couple therapy. This study investigates the suitability of conversational agents for individual therapy for couple problems. Couple Therapy Chatbot is a Wizard-of-Oz intervention using cognitive-behavioural couple therapy (CBCT) with individuals via an instant messaging platform. 12 participants trialled Couple Therapy Chatbot via single-session therapy. A qualitative self-reported questionnaire provided suitability insights. Thematic analysis revealed that while some participants appreciate deep and constructive responses and human-like empathy, others dislike generic and impersonal responses. Using CAs for couple problems appears to be a suitable application and may assist in mitigating relationship dissolution.

The methods were tested in comparable interactive sonifications of 2D positions in a series of hand-navigation assessments with BVI and blindfolded sighted users, to validate the different approaches in environments without any visual feedback. Results highlighted that alternation and spatiality can be useful resources in sonified guidance, and that users accustomed to faster-than-regular audio speed replay tend to have more precise performances, while musical literacy only had a performance effect on methods highly dependent on aural skills. Ultimately, this work corroborates the notion that sonification may help BVI users perform better in day-to-day manual micro-guidance tasks such as retrieving items from a pantry, handling kitchen appliances, and properly discarding trash.",

    "TLDR": "Authoring of AR instructions is typically a time-consuming manual process that requires a user to use a desktop GUI interface or AR device for placing and animating 3D content. This is problematic because manual authoring does not scale to the myriad of product variations of many manufacturing companies. However, automatic authoring is possible, since companies already store data about their products in the form of a bill of materials and bill of processes. \nIn our paper, we present authAR, a novel desktop GUI based tool that combines bill of materials with geometric data of a factory workspace to automatically author AR picking instructions on racks and boxes. In addition, authAR uses this data to propose spatial layouts of racks and boxes according to a customizable optimization algorithm.\nWe conducted a preliminary expert review with four manufacturing workers. Our study showed that authAR has many potentials and was applicable to a real use case at the manufacturing company, Velux. The study contributes new knowledge to the field of AR authoring by including the views of domain experts and using real production data. Suggestions for improvements and new features as well as plans for a more thorough study are presented as future work.",

However, automatic authoring is possible, since companies already store data about their products in the form of a bill of materials and bill of processes. \nIn our paper, we present authAR, a novel desktop GUI based tool that combines bill of materials with geometric data of a factory workspace to automatically author AR picking instructions on racks and boxes. In addition, authAR uses this data to propose spatial layouts of racks and boxes according to a customizable optimization algorithm.\nWe conducted a preliminary expert review with four manufacturing workers. Our study showed that authAR has many potentials and was applicable to a real use case at the manufacturing company, Velux. The study contributes new knowledge to the field of AR authoring by including the views of domain experts and using real production data. Suggestions for improvements and new features as well as plans for a more thorough study are presented as future work.",

    "TLDR": "Usability and design of serious game technologies have been widely investigated as academic interventions tools for children with autism. However, besides the technology, the sociocultural and institutional context also impacts the gameplay activities of children with autism as well as the external support provided by instructors. Therefore, this paper investigates i) the impact of sociocultural and institutional context over the engagement of children with autism with serious game technologies, ii) the types of external support children with autism are offered or require during gameplay session, and iii) the type of rewards and encouragers that can act as unbiased support to increase the engagement of the children with autism during gameplay.\nThis paper investigates these factors with an inductive analysis of educational gameplay activities of 23 children with autism in Lahore, Pakistan. Our study found that sociocultural and institutional context has substantial impact over the gameplay activities of children with autism. Children required both physical and verbal support during the gameplay activities, and institutional context influences the behavior of instructors as well. Finally, dynamic animations, rewards and encouragers can keep the children engaged for longer in the gameplay.",

Low-power technology such as e-ink or flip-dot displays have provided some alternatives, and living media displays present a new opportunity to study displays that consume low amounts of energy. This pilot study explores the design space for a moss-based dispaly installed in a design school, through think-aloud, observation and interview with 10 participants. The study found that users enjoyed the novelty, appearance and interaction with the moss display, showing promise for future applications. We contribute three design considerations and potential applications based on these findings.",

    "TLDR": "Against a backdrop of algorithms that disempower, dehumanise, disenfranchise and discriminate, there are increasing calls to centre the human in AI development processes and to humanise AI development in practice; centring dignity in AI development could provide a way forward. Despite the inclusion of dignity in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics frameworks, like many other AI ethics principles, there is little operational understanding of what dignity can look like in practice when it comes to the development of algorithms. Drawing on cybernetics and a model of dignity developed in the field of international conflict resolution, this paper presents our work-in-progress tool - the Dignity Lens - for considering dignity throughout the AI development lifecycle, and practitioner reflections from using the tool. This work is an initial step towards articulating what dignity-centred AI development could look like in practice, assisting practitioners designing and developing algorithms to actively consider dignity.",
