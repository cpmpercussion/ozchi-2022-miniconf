## The *room*

Some examples of HCI practice are better experienced than talked about on a
bunch of PPT slides. (Honestly, is there _anything_ that's not better
experienced than talked about on a bunch of PPT slides?) If you've got an
interactive system exploring sculpture, sound art, design, or any other
embodied + situated setup that you can bring along and set up in a room for
coference members to experience and enjoy, then we'd love to hear from you.
