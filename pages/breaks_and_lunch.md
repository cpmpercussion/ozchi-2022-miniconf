title: Breaks and Lunch
---

Breaks and lunch will take place at the Shine Dome Jaeger Room (just outside the Ian Wark Theatre).

Two coffee/refreshment breaks will be provided and a catered lunch will be available on site.

The breaks are an ideal time to check out the [creativity installation program](creativity.html) which will be on display in the Jaeger Room.
