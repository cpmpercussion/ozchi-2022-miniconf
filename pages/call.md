title: Call for Submissions
---

### Papers

Papers should present original research and mature work in HCI,
interaction design, and related fields. These papers may describe
investigations of user needs or contexts of use, lab-based evaluations
or field deployments of prototypes, or other design-led or empirical
investigations examining the relationship between people and technology.
Given the impact of Covid-19 on conducting research studies, authors are
encouraged to also consider submitting theory-based contributions that
make a clear contribution to the field.

We no longer have the category of "Short Papers", but we accept
submissions to the Papers track that are any length between 9 and 18
pages (excluding references) in the new, single column ACM Master
Article Template. The length of the paper should correspond to the
contribution it makes.

We are planning OzCHI 2022 as a hybrid conference. Papers can be
delivered in person or as online presentations. Accepted submissions
will be published in the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series
available from the ACM Digital Library.

### Late-Breaking Work and Case Studies

Late-Breaking Work (LBW) submissions present ideas that are emerging and
would benefit from discussion with members of the HCI community. These
submissions may include initial findings from new research, experiences
of reflective practitioners, and first drafts of novel concepts and
approaches.

Case studies may be based on academic or industry projects, and should
describe recent, topical work to fit the "late-breaking" theme of this
track. For example, this may include projects describing the application
of HCI or interaction design principles for addressing pandemic-related
challenges.

LBW and Case Study submissions may be up to 8 pages (excluding
references) in the single-column ACM format.

At the OzCHI 2022 hybrid conference LBW will be delivered as short
presentations in person or online. Accepted submissions will be
published in the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series
available from the ACM Digital Library.

### Workshops

Workshops aim to bring together researchers in the field of HCI to 
discuss and interact on specific topics of interest. Organisers of 
accepted workshops will be required to solicit position papers and 
accept responsibility for conducting the workshop.

Workshops are intended to foster discussion and exchange of ideas. 
Because focused interaction among participants is important, participants 
should have informed positions based on prior experience. This is typically
expressed in position papers submitted by workshop attendees. Workshops 
should not be miniature paper presentation sessions or panels, but focus 
on community building and communal knowledge creation through discussion 
and collective synthesis work. Workshop proposals can include different 
modes of conducting the workshops, i.e. remote only, hybrid or in-person only.

Here are a few examples of accepted workshops from previous years:

- [Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI) & Designing for Animal Interaction (AXD): OzACI, an Australian chapter](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292147.3293453)
- [Challenges of Emerging Technologies for Human-Centred Design: Bridging the Gap between Inquiry and Invention](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292147.3293451)
- [Interaction Design for Explainable AI](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292147.3293450)
- [Educational Virtuality: cognitive benefits, design processes and new frontiers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292147.3295498)
- [On and Off the Table: Re-Imagining Food and Wine Interactions (in the wild)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3292147.3293452)

### Creativity Track

In 2022 the OzCHI creativity track has two parts: the *gig* (a live event) and
the *room* (an installation space which will be open throughout the
conference). Submissions for each will be curated and selected selected by the
conference organisers.

Creativity submissions may be related to submissions in another track or standalone.
For creativity submission information see the [creativity page](http://www.ozchi.org/2022/creativity.html).

### Selection process

Papers and LBW will undergo a dual anonymous review by an international
panel of at least 3 reviewers and be evaluated based on their
significance, originality, and clarity of writing. This review will be
based on the full text of the submission.

Papers should:

-   have clear **significance** in terms of contribution to HCI or a
    related field;
-   offer a high level of **technical quality** in terms of related
    work, data, methods, and analysis;
-   and demonstrate **clarity of writing** at a level ready for
    publication in the ACM digital library.

LBW and Case Study submissions should:

- address a question of **significance** to the OzCHI community and
    stimulate interesting, novel conversations around the issue;
- demonstrate sufficient **technical quality** in the framing of the
    problem, related work, or methods;
- and demonstrate **clarity of writing** at a level ready for
    publication in the ACM digital library.

Workshops will be selected through evaluation by the Workshops chair. 
The chairs will consider fit and contribution to HCI community as well as 
relation to other submitted workshops. Workshop proposals should:

- consider potential of the topic of the workshop to **engage** with OzCHI 
community, generate stimulating discussion;
- have a **focused and well-organised** plan for the workshop;
- and demonstrate **clarity of writing** at a level ready for
    publication in the ACM digital library.

### Advice for new reviewers

Please consider volunteering to sign up as a reviewer via PCS.

If you are new to reviewing for an academic conference, we suggest that
you discuss this with your supervisor and/or to seek advice from
experienced colleagues. There are also great resources on how to write a
good review available online, e.g. [Ken Hickley's advice on excellence in reviews](http://mobilehci.acm.org/2015/download/ExcellenceInReviewsforHCICommunity.pdf)
(PDF) and the [RICELab's guide to writing reviews for HCI research.](https://ricelab.github.io/blog/2018/writing-reviews-for-hci/)

Keep in mind that your role as a reviewer is to help the authors to
bring their paper to the next level. When you write your review, imagine
the kind of review you'd like to receive if it was your paper. If you
have any questions, feel free to contact our Paper and LBW Case Study
chairs.

Paper reviews need to be completed by 22 July and LBW and Case Study
reviews by 09 September.

### Awards

Awards are presented to the highest quality papers and reviews.

-   Gitte Lindgaard Award (Best Paper)
-   Steve Howard Award (Best Student Paper)
-   Best Reviewer Award (for the top 3 reviewers, based on quality and
    quantity of reviews)

### Registration

At least one author of each accepted paper must register with OzCHI and
present the paper at the conference. Updates on registration and
presentation format will be published on the OzCHI website.
