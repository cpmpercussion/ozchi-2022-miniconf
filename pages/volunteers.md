# Apply to be a student volunteer

We are currently looking for student volunteers who will help the conference organisers run OzCHI 2022 in Canberra. Specifically, we are looking for enthusiastic, motivated and reliable masterâ€™s or PhD students, who can confidently get the job done, while enjoying and interacting professionally with delegates. No experience is required, though if you've done this before, either for OzCHI or another conference, this will be especially welcome.

All students, regardless of their discipline, are encouraged to apply.

As a volunteer, you will work as a team with other volunteers to support the committee in running the conference and at the same time you will learn the latest in the field of Human-Computer Interaction.
