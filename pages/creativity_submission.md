title: Creativity Track
---

OzCHI 2022's theme is **connected creativity**. To emphasise this we have a
_Creativity_ track featuring works from community related to creative computing,
games, interactive art, music and more. This year's creativity chair is [Ben
Swift](https://benswift.me).

The creativity track has two parts: the *gig* (a live event on Thursday night)
and the *room* (an installation space which will be open throughout the
conference). Both are in-person, although we may be able to stream the *gig*,
but that's TBC. Submissions for each will be curated and selected selected by
the conference organisers.

Creativity submissions may be related to submissions in another track, or they
may be standalone.

### The *gig* (Algorave)

These days just about all electronic music is made using computers, but with
artificial barriers between the people creating the software algorithms and the
people making the music. Using systems built for creating algorithmic music and
visuals, such as [Pd/puredata](https://puredata.info),
[Max/MSP](http://cycling74.com/products/max/),
[SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io),
[Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io),
[TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org), [Gibber](https://gibber.cc), [Sonic
Pi](https://sonic-pi.net), [FoxDot](https://foxdot.org),
[hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz), [p5.js](https://www.teddavis.org/p5live/),
[Cyril](http://cyrilcode.com) and [more](https://toplap.org), these barriers are
broken down, and musicians are able to compose and work live with their music as
algorithms. This has good and bad sides, but a different approach leads to
interesting places.

This is no new idea, but [Algoraves](https://algorave.com) focus on humans
making and dancing to music. Algorave musicians don’t pretend their software is
being creative, they take responsibility for the music they make, shaping it
using whatever means they have. More importantly the focus is not on what the
musician is doing, but on the music, and people dancing to it. Algoraves embrace
the alien sounds of raves from the past, and introduce alien, futuristic rhythms
and beats made through strange, algorithm-aided processes. It’s up to the good
people on the dancefloor to help the musicians make sense of this and do the
real creative work in making a great party.

**To get on the bill for the _gig_ (Algorave) track**, send us:

- a recorded (audio + video preferred, but audio-only ok) example of your work
- a one-paragraph description of your proposed performance
- a tech rider describing your required AV setup (we will have a stereo PA and
  HD data projector)

### The *room*

Some examples of HCI practice are better experienced than talked about on a
bunch of PPT slides[^ppt]. If you've got an interactive system exploring
sculpture, sound art, design, or any other embodied + situated setup that you
can bring along and set up in a room for coference members to experience and
enjoy, then we'd love to hear from you.

**To submit a work to the _room_ track**, send us:

- a recorded (audio + video preferred, but audio-only ok) example of your system
  in action
- a one-paragraph description of the work
- a tech rider describing your setup (size, required power/data/AV connectivity,
  any other sound/lighting requirements)
  
[^ppt]: 
    Honestly, is there _anything_ that's not better experienced than talked
    about on a bunch of PPT slides?

### Submission

Send your submission following the above formats to
[ben.swift@anu.edu.au](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au?subject=ozchi-creativity) by
12 August 2022.
