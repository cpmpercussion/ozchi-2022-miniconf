title: Creativity Track
---

In 2022 the OzCHI creativity track has two parts: the *gig* (a live event on
Thursday night) and the *room* (an installation space which will be open
throughout the conference). Submissions for each will be curated and selected
through a single-blind peer-review process with at least two reviewers. selected
by the conference organisers.

*** The *gig* (Algorave)

These days just about all electronic music is made using computers, but with
artificial barriers between the people creating the software algorithms and the
people making the music. Using systems built for creating algorithmic music and
visuals, such as IXI Lang, Pd/puredata, Max/MSP, SuperCollider, Extempore,
Fluxus, TidalCycles, Gibber, Sonic Pi, FoxDot and Cyril these barriers are
broken down, and musicians are able to compose and work live with their music as
algorithms. This has good and bad sides, but a different approach leads to
interesting places.

This is no new idea, but Algoraves focus on humans making and dancing to music.
Algorave musicians don’t pretend their software is being creative, they take
responsibility for the music they make, shaping it using whatever means they
have. More importantly the focus is not on what the musician is doing, but on
the music, and people dancing to it. Algoraves embrace the alien sounds of raves
from the past, and introduce alien, futuristic rhythms and beats made through
strange, algorithm-aided processes. It’s up to the good people on the dancefloor
to help the musicians make sense of this and do the real creative work in making
a great party.

To get on the bill for the *gig* track, send us:

- a recorded (audio + video preferred, but audio-only ok) example of your work
- a one-paragraph description of your proposed performance
- a tech rider describing your required AV setup (we will have a stereo PA and
  HD data projector)

*** The *room*

Some examples of HCI practice are better experienced than talked about on a
bunch of PPT slides. If you've got an interactive system exploring sculpture,
sound art, design, or any other embodied + situated setup that you can bring
along and set up in a room for coference members to experience and enjoy, then
we'd love to hear from you.

To submit a work to the *room* track, send us:

- a recorded (audio + video preferred, but audio-only ok) example of your system
  in action
- a one-paragraph description of the work
- a tech rider describing your setup (size, required power/data/AV connectivity,
  any other sound/lighting requirements)
