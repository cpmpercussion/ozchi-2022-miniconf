<h3>Papers</h3>
<p>Papers should present original research and mature work in HCI,
interaction design, and related fields. These papers may describe
investigations of user needs or contexts of use, lab-based evaluations
or field deployments of prototypes, or other design-led or empirical
investigations examining the relationship between people and technology.
Given the impact of Covid-19 on conducting research studies, authors are
encouraged to also consider submitting theory-based contributions that
make a clear contribution to the field.</p>
<p>We no longer have the category of "Short Papers", but we accept
submissions to the Papers track that are any length between 9 and 18
pages (excluding references) in the new, single column ACM Master
Article Template. The length of the paper should correspond to the
contribution it makes.</p>
<p>We are planning OzCHI 2022 as a hybrid conference. Papers can be
delivered in person or as online presentations. Accepted submissions
will be published in the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series
available from the ACM Digital Library.</p>
<h3>Late-Breaking Work and Case Studies</h3>
<p>Late-Breaking Work (LBW) submissions present ideas that are emerging and
would benefit from discussion with members of the HCI community. These
submissions may include initial findings from new research, experiences
of reflective practitioners, and first drafts of novel concepts and
approaches.</p>
<p>Case studies may be based on academic or industry projects, and should
describe recent, topical work to fit the "late-breaking" theme of this
track. For example, this may include projects describing the application
of HCI or interaction design principles for addressing pandemic-related
challenges.</p>
<p>LBW and Case Study submissions may be up to 8 pages (excluding
references) in the single-column ACM format.</p>
<p>At the OzCHI 2022 hybrid conference LBW will be delivered as short
presentations in person or online. Accepted submissions will be
published in the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series
available from the ACM Digital Library.</p>
<h3>Workshops</h3>
<p>Workshops aim to bring together researchers in the field of HCI to 
discuss and interact on specific topics of interest. Organisers of 
accepted workshops will be required to solicit position papers and 
accept responsibility for conducting the workshop.</p>
<p>Workshops are intended to foster discussion and exchange of ideas. 
Because focused interaction among participants is important, participants 
should have informed positions based on prior experience. This is typically
expressed in position papers submitted by workshop attendees. Workshops 
should not be miniature paper presentation sessions or panels, but focus 
on community building and communal knowledge creation through discussion 
and collective synthesis work. Workshop proposals can include different 
modes of conducting the workshops, i.e. remote only, hybrid or in-person only.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of accepted workshops from previous years:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Creativity Track</h3>
<p>In 2022 the OzCHI creativity track has two parts: the <em>gig</em> (a live event) and
the <em>room</em> (an installation space which will be open throughout the
conference). Submissions for each will be curated and selected selected by the
conference organisers.</p>
<p>Creativity submissions may be related to submissions in another track or standalone.
For creativity submission information see the <a href="http://www.ozchi.org/2022/creativity.html">creativity page</a>.</p>

significance, originality, and clarity of writing. This review will be
based on the full text of the submission.</p>
<p>Papers should:</p>
<ul>
<li>have clear <strong>significance</strong> in terms of contribution to HCI or a
    related field;</li>
<li>offer a high level of <strong>technical quality</strong> in terms of related
    work, data, methods, and analysis;</li>
<li>and demonstrate <strong>clarity of writing</strong> at a level ready for
    publication in the ACM digital library.</li>
</ul>
<p>LBW and Case Study submissions should:</p>
<ul>
<li>address a question of <strong>significance</strong> to the OzCHI community and
    stimulate interesting, novel conversations around the issue;</li>
<li>demonstrate sufficient <strong>technical quality</strong> in the framing of the
    problem, related work, or methods;</li>
<li>and demonstrate <strong>clarity of writing</strong> at a level ready for
    publication in the ACM digital library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Workshops will be selected through evaluation by the Workshops chair. 
The chairs will consider fit and contribution to HCI community as well as 
relation to other submitted workshops. Workshop proposals should:</p>
<ul>
<li>consider potential of the topic of the workshop to <strong>engage</strong> with OzCHI 
community, generate stimulating discussion;</li>
<li>have a <strong>focused and well-organised</strong> plan for the workshop;</li>
<li>and demonstrate <strong>clarity of writing</strong> at a level ready for
    publication in the ACM digital library.</li>
</ul>
