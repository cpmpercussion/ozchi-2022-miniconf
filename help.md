More information will be up soon. Please email yichen.wang@anu.edu.au if you have any accessibility enquires about attending OzCHI2022.


## Who should I talk to if I have accessibility needs for attending OzCHI2022?

The Accessibility Chair for OzCHI2022 is Yichen Wang. If you have any accessibility needs or enquires such as wheelchair access, requesting transport during the conference, or any concerns related to accessibility, please email yichen.wang@anu.edu.au. We will try our best to see what we can work out with our venue [The Shine Dome](https://www.shinedome.org.au).


## General accessibility information about the conference venue 

The main program will be held at [The Shine Dome](https://www.shinedome.org.au), an [iconic Canberra landmark](https://visitcanberra.com.au/attractions/596ebadadb10920b612c3fef/shine-dome) constructed in 1959 for [The Australian Academy of Science's Shine Dome](https://www.shinedome.org.au/about).

Most of the rooms in this venue are located on the ground floor, which is easy to access. It provides:
- hearing loops and addition implementation if relevant needs are requested
- a new air circulating system that provides ventilation for COVID-19 safety concern
- an accessible unisex toilet
- accessible parking around the venue and ANU Acton campus

On Thursday 1 Dec, we are going to have a OzCHI creativity concert at [Ainslie +  Gorman Arts Centres](https://ainslieandgorman.com.au/plan-your-visit/general-information/), which you can check out the accessibility information in the link.
