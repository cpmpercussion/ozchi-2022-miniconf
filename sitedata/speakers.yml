  talktitle: "Creativity as a Health & Social Justice Right: Challenges/Opportunities for HCI"
  abstract: 
    Creativity is culturally valued as a path to innovation - often of technology and discovery. Our cultures are based on how creativity flourishes; is expressed; how it challenges and inspires. How it can be amazingly destructive or lift us out of ourselves, together. Creativity is multifaceted. It is located in the body. It is produced from within the whole body. The health, wellbeing, fitness of the body affects our creativity. We cannot express ourselves, engage with others, be kind to each other when we are tired, stressed, malnourished, isolated, without skills and resources to take care of ourselves. Our insights do not come when focused on survival. Without health and wellbeing (aka wellth) our creativity is compromised. So if we want to support creativity, innovation, discovery, how well do we create the conditions of wellth? The degree to which we develop infrastructures of health, we design to support, enable nurture creativity.
    In this talk I'd like to offer a brief model of the physiology of creativity, some pathways through what we've called Wellth Design to support that physiology, and to ask - how do we co-create these kinds of interactions at sufficient scale that they are so pervasive as to disappear like clean water? And what is our role and responsibility in such an effort?

  talktitle: The Impact of HCI 
  abstract: |
    "Research impact is the contribution that research makes to the economy, society, environment or culture, beyond the contribution to academic research." In the ACRA statement we say "the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) proposes consideration of the importance of the research problem solved, the approach taken and properties of the solution, the output describing such an approach, and how the approach in the research output has been built on or applied, including concrete evidence of impact." 

    In this talk, we will take a journey back in time to see what impact Research in Human-Computer Interaction has had on the world. In this journey, we will travel back through examples in the digital computing and predigital computing space. We will then explore yesterday's tomorrow before exploring today's tomorrow and finally tomorrow's tomorrow. 

    Along the way, we will discover the dimensions of impact and how you may plan your own research journey to maximise the potential for the impact of your own work. We will see examples of HCI research from falls Prediction to text prediction, from sensory substitution to sense making, from Data Visualization to Discreet Computing, or visualisation to core values, and Radar to recommender systems. 

    We will end with a call to Extend Our Capabilities  by Augmenting Interactions with the world around our bodies and the impact this can have for the 8 billion people alive today and the unborn generations to come.
