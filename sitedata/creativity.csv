1,The Hyperdimensional Resonator,Matthew Walsh,"The body is amassed with electrical signals. These bioelectric signals are tied
to both the most basic body functions such as the heart beating all the way to
the highest level of processing in the brain. These signals are often rhythmic
in nature and provide a means to measure the fundamental rhythms of any
individual. In this performance we will generate music in real time from
bioelectric signals that are read from a human subject. The ECG (heart) will set
the rhythm of the music while other signals including EEG (brain waves) and EMG
(muscles) will be used by an algorithm to perform melodic and rhythmic choices.
The subject will participate by dancing and responding to the generated music
and by virtue of their interaction will change the music produced. Additionally,
the signals will be sonified and form part of the music. Musician(s) will also
improvise along with the generated music with their instruments being modulated
by the captured bioelectric signals.","Matthew Walsh is a musician, software engineer and neuroscientist, obtaining a
PhD in Computational Neuroscience in 2020. His thesis topic was _Mean Field
Modelling of Epileptogenic Cortical Lesions Using The Liley Model_. This thesis
focussed on modelling the effects of cortical lesions on the EEG. Matthew has
now broadened his research interests to include the sonification and
musification of biological signals.

Matthew is vocalist, guitarist and songwriter for the Melbourne band _Your Creepy Ex_.",,,gig,,,,TRUE
2,The internet as metaphor for the Sea,Niamh McCool,"The sea is a continuing theme throughout Niamh's work. This piece considers the
metaphorical link between the internet and the sea, exploring how internet
artefacts - images, songs, videos, etc- appear to us, washed ashore on the
coasts of our phones and laptops pushed by the tides of algorithms. Using sound
samples from the deep depths of the internet, dark places unpopulated by ""likes""
or ""views"", 'The internet as metaphor for the sea' honours these rare pearls of
knowledge. The projected visuals of reflective tendrils sway and collide like
waves. Building seascapes with Pure Data and rhythmic waves of Tidal Cycle code,
this piece aims to pull the viewer into a synthesized aquatic world.","Niamh is a multi-disciplinary artist currently based in Ngunnal
Country/Canberra. Art, whatever the form, has always been Niamh's way to make
sense of the world. Niamh is all about accessibility of education, in particular
anything related to tech and creativity. By day, Niamh works as a tutor at ANU,

core. Rumour has it that Niamh is about to launch her own label.",,,gig,,,,TRUE
3,Latent Space,Rodolfo Ocampo,"This performance is a musical improvisation on top of a soundscape generated
using the System of a Down installation. The System of a Down installation was
developed as a collaboration between Rodolfo Ocampo, Oliver Bown, Uncanny Valley
and the School of Cybernetics to showcase the interconnectedness of human,
technological and environmental systems by turning Earth's data into a
generative soundscape.

The installation ingests data from Earth's complex systems, including CO2
levels, weather, economic indicators, and passes it as prompts to GPT-3 for it
to generate descriptions of the data. Via a semantic similarity computation,
these descriptions are then matched to sounds in a sound library that was tagged
by people describing each sound. Therefore, the soundscape is intended to 'feel'
like the data, by semantically matching AI generated data descriptions of data
to human generated descriptions of sounds.

Rodolfo uses this soundscape as a base for a real time musical improvisation
that can be understood as a way to jam with Earth's data. Throughout history,
humans have related to the Earth through stories and music. In a time where we
increasingly relate to the world through data, this performance is a playful
exploration that repurposes data technologies to relate to these systems in a
less rational, more emotional and improvisational way through music, assuming
oneself very as part of nature's orchestra.","Rodolfo Ocampo is a creative technologist from Mexico City, based in Sydney. He
is completing a PhD at UNSW School of Art and Design, researching how
interaction design can enable effective human-AI creative collaboration. He
originally came to Australia in 2020 to participate in the second cohort at the
3A Institute, now the School of Cybernetics at ANU. Previous to that, he worked
at Google for two years. Additionally he is currently working at CSIRO
developing tools for indigenous rangers to aid in management of Country.

He is interested in the creative intersection between the environment,
technology and people, and how artificial intelligence can enable new creative
possibilities. He recently co-developed an installation with music technology
company Uncanny Valley for the School of Cybernetics Building, which transforms
data from Earth's complex systems into a soundscape via semantic matching
between data descriptions and sound descriptions. His performance at OzChi uses
this installation soundscape as a base to improvise in real time with keyboards,
guitar and drums.

Recently, he also developed the viral app Narrative Device which enabled people
to write short stories with GTP-3. Previous to that, he developed a nationally
touring art installation in Mexico that repurposed face recognition technologies
to protest the war on drugs. He works as an independent consultant and developer
for creative projects that involve interactions between people, technology and
the environment.",,,gig,,,,TRUE

8,LiveSpoken 2,Kofi Oduro (illestpreacha),"LiveSpoken 2 is a presentation and performance of how live-coding can transcend the screen. Combining it with the improvisational nature of the cypher, commonly seen in the hip-hop community. In this performance, not only will the code be improvised in environments such as sonic pi but the songwriting and vocal elements will also be improvised, so the audience can witness some of the stages that go into a freestyle session.  The addition in LiveSpoken 2 is the improvised visual components such as but not restricted to livecodelab.net, inverse.website (poetic livecoding) & Hydra .This gives the audience a live performance that showcases the merger that can occur between life, science and art in a spectacle. It also shows artists from different mediums that are traditionally not digital : painting, installations, poetry as well as digital ones : audio, animation that there is a way to create in isolation.","Kofi Oduro (illestpreacha) is an experiential storyteller that transforms data, words and code into experiences that nurtures discussion, reflection, and interaction. With a decade plus of performance, event & audiovisual production, he takes inspiration from endeavours that are not normally together to create a harmonic experience for audiences.

His artistic practice is an observation of the world around us that he puts into artworks for others to relate to or disagree with. Through Videography, Poetry and Creative Coding, He tries to highlight the realms of human performance and the human mind in different scenarios. These situations can be described as social, internal, or even biological, which we face in our everyday lives. Adding music and visuals often helps to perceive one's own feelings, and to highlight the different subtleties that make us human.",,,room,,,,TRUE
9,A Comic-based Digital Storytelling Showcase to Support Positive Mental Health Outcomes,Hilary Davis|Darren C. Fisher,"Comic-based digital stories are brief but powerful illustrated digital stories. Comic-based digital storytelling has unique characteristics that provide much promise for Human Computer Interaction. Often associated with young people's entertainment, comics cover a broad range of topics, from superheros, to farming life (e.g., Footrot Flats). We have been co-creating comic-based digital stories in partnership with mental health programs in three contexts: a Victorian rural outreach program; tradespeople or 'tradies' focused mental health promotion program; and a student mental health service.

We showcase three diverse comic-based digital stories co-created with key stakeholders including service providers, community members and people with lived experience of mental health. They depict contextually situated mental health issues faced in the trades sector and in rural communities. The digital stories recognise some complexities of identifying mental health issues and help-seeking in these contexts. Comics were chosen for these digital stories due to their unique ability to resonate with young male audiences, create understanding, and help bridge health literacy and digital divides ([ref](https://www.academia.edu/62913326/_I_Understand_Mate_A_Co_Designed_Comic_based_Digital_Story_from_Down_Under)). They can be viewed online on personal devices or displayed during group outreach activities. A synopsis for the digital stories is below.

**Trigger warning!** Please be aware these videos include content about mental health issues, domestic violence, drug use, suicide ideation and suicide.

#### How to have a tough conversation about mental health

This auto-biographical 'origin' story showcases HALT (Hope and Assistance Local Tradies) health promotion presentations to tradespeople to highlight tradies mental health issues, reduce stigma in the trades industry and encourage mental health support uptake.

#### Slamming the Mental Health Stigma at TAFE

This digital story was originally created as a comic-based booklet depicting mental health support provided by SLAM, a Technical and Further Education (TAFE) student support team. The booklet was distributed with student orientation handouts, shared during HALT-TAFE presentations, and will be shared online.

#### The Rural Outreach Program illustrated digital story

This digital story was codesigned with a partnering organisation, rural outreach workers, local police and community members. It depicts the story of 'Sam' a young man struggling to cope with issues at home and illustrates how the rural outreach program supported him.","#### Hilary Davis

Hilary is a Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for Social Impact, Swinburne University of Technology. Her work investigates the role technologies play in people’s work, social and home lives.
