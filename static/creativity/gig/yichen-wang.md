# Cubing Sound Ensemble

Head-mounted mixed reality presents new opportunities for natural musical
control in three dimensions for facilitating musical creativity, yet existing
works are limited to using hand-held controllers. In OzCHI this year, we present
a free-improvised performance consisting of a novel 3D musical expression in AR.
Audiences can see how a NIME (new interface for musical expression) in AR
activates mobility, space and sound by the performer in musical performance.
