## Artist bios

### Ushini Attanayake

Ushini Attanayake is a live coder, educator and PhD candidate in the School of
Computing at the Australian National University. Her research interests lie in
computing education, creative computing and co-creative agents. Her doctoral
research involves developing a notion of proficiency within creative computing
education while drawing on existing notions of proficiency in visuals arts,
music and computing. Focussing on late secondary and early tertiary education,
she will explore the efficacy of various approaches used to evaluate learning in
creative computing. She is passionate about developing creative computing
educational material, particularly for outreach programs aimed at delivering
computing education to underrepresented demographics.

Her creative practices include live coding performances, which have lately been
heavily influenced by classical Indian rhythmic structures. As a house dancer
and music maker, she continues to look for ways to bridge these two interest
through small projects involving wearable devices in her spare time.

### Ben Swift

Dr. Ben Swift is an interdisciplinary scholar and artist-programmer with
interests in computational art & music, cybernetics, AI/machine learning, data
vis/data science and human-computer interaction. A unifying thread is the
potential of liveness (human-in-the-loop interactivity with real-time feedback)
in tools and workflows, especially in open-ended creative tasks.
