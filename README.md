## About OzCHI

OzCHI is the annual non-profit conference for the Computer-Human Interaction Special Interest Group (CHISIG) and Australia's leading forum for the latest in HCI research and practice. OzCHI attracts a broad international community of researchers, industry practitioners, academics and students. Participants come from a range of backgrounds and include interaction designers, user experience (UX) practitioners, information architects, software engineers, human factors experts, information systems analysts and social scientists.

## Connected Creativity

The theme of OzCHI 2022 is "connected creativity", this year we want to acknowledge the value of connections between researchers, technologies, society and country and the creative expressions of these connections. To emphasise this theme we are introducing a special [creativity track](creativity.html) for OzCHI 2022 to present creative computing works including art, games, media and music that connect with and extend human-computer interaction.
